**Question 1**
What method of design did we use to use in Canada, but don't any more?
Group of answer choices

Limit State Design
Strength
✔️Factor of Safety
Stiffness
We don't follow a prescribed method

**Question 2**
What method of design do we use now in Canada (and most of the world)?
Group of answer choices

✔️Limit State Design
We don't follow a prescribed method
Strength
Factor of Safety
Stiffness

**Question 3**
Pick all the types of Forces that must meet the Strength design requirements (ie the factored load must be less than the reduced capacity)
Group of answer choices

Stiffness
Vibration
✔️Compression
Comfort
✔️Torsion
✔️Tension
✔️Bending Moment
✔️Shear
Cracked Finishes

**Question 4**
For a beam that is 7.6 meters long (L), what deflection is allowed if the steel beam is part of a roof, supporting finishes that can be easily damaged and are susceptible to cracking for Snow Load?
Provide an answer in mm to one (XX.X) decimal place. Do not write the units.

[[Periodic Notes/Atomic/2025/2025-02/2025-02-12_Assignment 01/Attachments/2025-02-12_Assignment 01/SERVICEABILITY LIMITS.pdf|SERVICEABILITY LIMITS]]
7.6 * 1000 / 360 = 21.1

**Question 5**
For a beam that is 6.3 meters long (L), what deflection is allowed if the steel beam is part of a roof, supporting finishes that can be easily damaged and are susceptible to cracking for the Total Load (Dead + Snow)?
Provide an answer in mm to one (XX.X) decimal place. Do not write the units.

6.3 * 1000 / 240 = 26.3

**Question 6**
For a beam that is 2.29 meters long (L), what deflection is allowed if the wood beam is part of a floor, not supporting finishes that can be easily damaged for the Live Load?
Provide an answer in mm to one (X.X) decimal place. Do not write the units.

2.29 * 1000 / 300 = 7.6

**Question 7**
For a beam that is L=8'-5" long, what deflection is allowed if the wood beam is part of a floor, supporting finishes that aren't easily damaged for the Total Load (Dead + Live)?
Provide an answer in **mm** to one (XX.X) decimal place. Do not write the units.

(8 * 12 + 5) * 25.4 / 180 = 14.3

**Question 8**
What type of failure do you think this is?

Strength
Stiffness
✔️Stability

**Question 9**

![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/Pasted image 20250108182058.png|300]]

Strength
Stability
✔️Stiffness

**Question 10**
What type of failure do you think this is?
Group of answer choices

✔️Strength
Stability
Stiffness

The next few Questions are a math refresher
**Question 11**
What is the numerical value of the following:
$4.62^5$
Provide an answer to zero decimal places.

2,105

**Question 12**
What is the numerical value of the following:
$\sqrt[5]{100}$
Provide an answer to three significant figures.

Rewrite $\sqrt[5]{100}$​ as $100^{1/5}$
2.512

**Question 13**
What is the Scientific Notation for the following number, with 3 significant figures?
6,502,904.105
Group of answer choices

6.50
6.502904105x106
✔️6.50x106
6.503x106

**Question 14**
What is the value of z if:
y=8.62 and x=4.11
![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/Pasted image 20250108182513.png|200]]
Write the answer to two decimal places.

$\sqrt[2]{8.62^2+4.11^2}=9.55$

**Question 15**
What is the value of θ if:
y=16.4 and x=10.9
![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/Pasted image 20250108182602.png|200]]
Note: NEW x and y values from Question 14
Write the answer in degrees to one decimal place.

$\sin\theta=\left(\frac{x}{y}\right)$
$\theta=\arcsin\left(\frac{10.9}{16.4}\right)=41.7$

**Question 16**
The following chart shows the Compressive Capacity (Cr) of different steel columns at various effective lengths (KL). What is the Compressive Capacity of a W310x74 with a KL=5,116mm?
![[../../../../../docs/assets/img/Pasted image 20250108182629.png|600]]
TIP: Interpolate
Provide an answer in kN to zero (XXXX) decimal places. Do not write the units.

$\frac{\left(1170-1250\right)}{\left(5250-5000\right)}\times\left(5116-5000\right)+1250=1213$

**This section is not marked.**
Write your answers down somewhere and save them for when the answers are published next week. This is a thinking exercise, and sometimes it's not always obvious. The different answers may be Axial, Shear, Bending, Stiffness and Stability.

What type of failure do we experience as we take each step?
Stiffness
What type of failure occurs to paper, when we cut it with scissors?
Shear
What type of failure happens to the butter when you spread it on toast?
Shear
What type of failure occurs with each chew of chewing gum?
Axial
What type of failure do we experience when drywall cracks?
Stiffness
What type of failure happens when a ladder slides away from a building?
