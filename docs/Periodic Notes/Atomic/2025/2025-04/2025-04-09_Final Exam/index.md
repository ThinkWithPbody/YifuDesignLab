$\Delta=\frac{5wL^4}{384\times E I}$
$E I=\frac{5wL^4}{384\times \Delta}$
$I=\frac{5 \times 5.9N/mm \times 7248mm^4}{384\times 30.2mm \times 200,000N/mm^2}=92.2\times 10^6 mm^4$

- ✔️646 kN
- 87 kN
- 450 kN
- 589 kN
- 347 kN

$P_y=f_yA$ or find in [STEEL COLUMN TABLES](../../../../../Courses/2025/ARC2046H/Attachments/ARC2046H/STEEL%20COLUMN%20TABLES.pdf)

## Question 18

- 589 kN
- ✔️347 kN
- 87 kN

- $P_\text{cr}=\frac{\pi^2\cdot E\cdot I}{(kL)^2}$

	- $\pi$: 3.14159
	- $E$: The modulus of elasticity of the material
	- $I$: The moment of inertia in the direction that the member is allowed to buckle (often Iyy)
	- $kL$: The effective length of the member

$I=\pi(d^4-d_1^4)/64=4,765,969mm^4$
