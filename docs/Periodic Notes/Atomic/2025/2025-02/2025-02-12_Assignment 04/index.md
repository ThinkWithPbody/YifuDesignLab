![200](/docs/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020250129164516.png)

✔️2.48 mm
4.198 m
4.202 m
6.77 m
Not enough information

$A=75\times150-(75-8)\times(150-20)=2540mm^2$
$\Delta L=\frac{P\cdot L}{E \cdot A}=\frac{300kN\times4.2m}{200000MPA|N/mm^2\times2540mm^2}=2.48mm$

Write your answer in kNm to 2 decimal places (X.XX). Do not write the units.


$1 lbs=0.4535924 kg$
$Gravity=9.80665 m/s^2$
$P=(135+190)lbs\times0.4535924 kg/lbs\times9.80665 m/s^2=1,445.67 N|kg\cdot m/s^2$
$M=0kNm=R_M-P\times2m$
$R_M=P\times2m=2,891.34Nm=2.89kNm$

**Question 10**
Where is the centroid of the stress distribution shown?
![300](/docs/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020250129164114.png)
Measure from the left hand side. Give your answer in mm to 0 decimal places (XXX). Do not write the units.

$500mm\times\frac{2}{3}=333mm$

---

**Question 11**
What is the Equivalent Point Load?
Remember that there is a dimension into the page we can't see, so give your answer in N/mm to 0 decimal places (XXXX).
Do not write the units.

$P=w\cdot l=10MPa|N/mm^2\times500mm=5000N/mm$

---

There are NO MARKS for this question.
For the following images, where is the centroid of the stress distribution and what is the Equivalent Point Load? Pay attention to units.

**Question 12**
σ  = 237 MPa  
S = 31,008 mm3  
M = ? kNm
Write your answer in kNm to 2 decimal places (X.XX). Do not write the units.

$M=\sigma\cdot S=237N/mm^2\times31,008mm^3=7,348,896Nmm=7.35kNm$

---

**Question 13**
M = 17.2 kNm  
S = 35,693 mm3  
σ = ?
Write your answer in MPa to 0 decimal places (XXX). Do not write the units.

$\sigma=17200000Nmm\div35,693mm^3=482N/mm^2|MPa$

---

This is a multiple part question using the following information:

You have just finished designing an I beam for a building that has a Mmax=480kNm. The fabricator just called and said they are all out of steel sections in 350W steel (The normal standard for I sections), and only have steel sections with yield stress of 240MPa! We've got to do some re-design. Remember that σyield is the maximum stress we'd ever want to see.

**Question 14**
What elastic section modulus (S mm3) would you need for your new section?
Write the answer in mm3 to zero decimal places. It's a big number.

$S=\frac{M}{\sigma}=480,000,000Nmm\div240N/mm^2=2,000,000mm^3$

---

**Question 15**
What plastic section modulus (Z mm3) would you need for your new section?
Write the answer in mm3 to zero decimal places. It's a big number.

$Z=\frac{M}{\sigma}=480,000,000Nmm\div240N/mm^2=2,000,000mm^3$

---

**Question 16**
Assuming we keep the design in the ELASTIC range, would this section work?
![200](/docs/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020250129171928.png)

Yes
✔️No

$S_\text{rectangular section}=bd^2/6=1,500,000mm^3<2,000,000mm^3$

---

**Question 17**
Assuming we allow the design to make use of the PLASTIC range, would this section work?
![200](/docs/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020250129171928.png)

✔️Yes
No

$Z_\text{rectangular section}=bd^2/4=2,250,000mm^3>2,000,000mm^3$

---

**Question 18**
Assuming we keep the design in the ELASTIC range, would this section work?
![200](/docs/assets/img/Pasted%20image%2020250129172018.png)

✔️Yes
No

$$S_\text{I Beam section}=\frac{bd^3-(b-w)(d-2t)^3}{6d}=\frac{200\times400^3-(200-20)(400-2\times25)^3}{6\times400}=2,117,708.33mm^3>2,000,000mm^3$$

You are designing a pedestrian bridge over the Humber River, and the design team really wants it to be crisp and sharp. They’ve elected to use a section that might not be the most efficient, but they want your help deciding what small adjustments can make a difference. The element has to stay in the elastic range. Don't forget to factor your loads!

Bridge Length = 16 m  
Bridge Width = 3000 mm *Each side takes half the width!  
Self Weight = 2.0 kPa  
Live Load = 4.8 kPa  
Yield Stress = 0.9 * 350 MPa

**Question 19**
They are hoping to use 200mm by 200mm solid steel as their girders, for a boxy look. Will it work?

Yes
✔️No

Using [Ultimate Limit States Calculator](index.md#Ultimate%20Limit%20States%20Calculator)
$Ultimate Limit State: UDL = 9.7 kPa|kN/m^2$
$w=9.7kN/m^2\times\frac{1}{2}3000mm=14.55kN/m$
$M(kNm|1,000,000 Nmm)=\frac{W(kN/m)\cdot L^2(m^2)}{8}=\frac{14.55\times16^2}{8}=465.6kNm|465,600,000Nmm$
$S=\frac{M}{\sigma}=\frac{465,600,000Nmm}{0.9\times350MPa|N/mm^2}=1,478,095.238mm^3$
$S_\text{rectangular section}=\frac{b(mm) \cdot d^2(mm^2)}{6}=\frac{200 \cdot 200^2}{6}=1,333,333<S$

---

**Question 20**
Does it work if we increase only the width by 25mm?

✔️Yes
No

$S_\text{rectangular section}=\frac{225 \cdot 200^2}{6}=1,500,000>S$

---

**Question 21**
Does it work if we increase only the depth by 25mm? 

✔️Yes
No

$S_\text{rectangular section}=\frac{200 \cdot 225^2}{6}=1,687,500>S$

---

**Question 22**
Which has more of an impact on the capacity, increasing the depth or width?

Width
✔️Depth
