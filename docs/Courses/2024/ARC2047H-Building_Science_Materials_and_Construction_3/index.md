**Cooling via Cross Ventilation (Natural Ventilation)**
- q_crossvent (Btu/h) = V (cfm) × Heat capacity of air (Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)) × ∆T (°F)
	- A unit of power
	- Requires openings on both sides and wind perpendicular to the opening surface
	- V: Volumetric flow rate (cfm: cubic feet per minute)
		- **V (cfm) = Cv × A (ft2) × v (fpm)**
			- Cv = **0.55 perpendicular, 0.3 angled**: coefficient for wind direction compared to the opening
			- A = area of the opening
				- Bottleneck is the **smaller of the two**
			- v = velocity of the wind in feet per minute
				- **1 mile per hour (mph) = 88 feet per minute (fpm)**
	- **Heat capacity of air** Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h) = 0.018 Btu/(ft3·°F) × 60 min/h = **1.08 Btu·min/(ft3·°F·h)**
		- OR heat capacity of air (Btu/(ft3·°F)) = density (pounds per cubic ft) × specific heat of air (Btu/(lb·°F))
	- ∆T is temperature difference between inside and outside air
		- At least 3°F for cross ventilation to be feasible

**Degree Days**
- Has units of (degrees · days)
- HDD: Heating Degree Days
	- HDD = BPT - Ave Temp
	- HDD for the day is ignored if average outside temperature is warmer than balance point temperature
- CDD: Cooling Degree Days
	- CDD = Ave Temp - BPT
	- CDD for the day is ignored if average outside temperature is cooler than balance point temperature
- [degreeedays](http://degreedays.net)

**Cost of Thermal Comfort (Heating and Cooling)**
- Heating
	- Annual Heat Needed (Btu) = UA_total (Btu/h×℉) × HDD × 24 hours
	- Annual Fuel Needed, **E (ft3) = Annual Heat (Btu) ÷ (AFUE × heat value of fuel (Btu/ft3))**
		- Specific to the fuel source and equipment
		- **AFUE** is the Annual Fuel Utilization Efficiency
			- Assume 95%
			- Natural gas furnaces have an AFUE range between 80% to 98.5%
		- Heat value for natural gas is **1050 Btu/ft3**
	- **Annual Cost of Heating** (\$) = E × Cost of Fuel ($/ft3)
		- Currently (October 2024) the effective gas supply rate is about 7.7043 cents per cubic meter for commercial customers of Enbridge in Toronto. 1 m3 = 35.315 ft3, thus 0.218 cents per ft3 or $0.00218/ft3 or $2.18/1000 ft3
		- Sometimes as **$ per thousand cubic feet**
- Cooling
	- Summer BPT needed for Summer Cooling Cost
		- **Rough** estimate is adding 10F to the Winter BPT. This assume higher indoor setpoint, no shading, and no open windows for cross ventilation.
			- Historically 50°F was used as the base temperature for calculating annual cooling.
			- If we can provide shading to some of the south glass we can improve the Summer BPT.
			- assume 80% effective shading, thus allowing 20% of the solar gain.
		- **BPT = T_desired - Q_i ÷ UA_total**
			- T_desired ?= 78°F (25.6°C)
			- Q_i: Heat gain
			- UA_total: Heat loss

Geo Exchange
- Under construction
    - 250 Tons of heating or cooling currently
    - 400 - 800 ton eventually
- Offsets carbon for many buildings - 50% in the next 6 years
    - 100000 people on campus
    - Offsets 15000 tons of CO2
- Preheat or precool the loop
    - 10-12 C temperature from geoexchange - drastically less delta T
    - 20C instead of 40C delta T
    - Use geoexchange both ways, heating or cooling, or you'll saturate the battery quickly
    - Geoexchange cannot heat or cool by itself, the buildings need heat pumps for next level of exchange
- Half the CN tower height going down
    - 250 meters deep
        - 372 boreholes
        - Incredibly small because it goes down vertically instead of spreading out horizontally
            - much more expensive than conventional but much more capacity and efficiency
    - 30 Campus buildings connected
    - 170000 Litres of fluid in the system
    - 190 km of piping
        - 300 horse power to overcome skin friction inside pipes
    - 15.2 million kWh energy stored
- Garage
    - level 3 battery operated charger
        - First in the world
        - Triple charges at night
        - Can be used all day - fully charges a car every 30 minutes
        - Normally level 3 spike in demand has to burn fuel to draw from the grid
- Canada burns fossil fuel for heating - large carbon footprint
- Cooling towers are still burning fuel running steam turbine and fossil fuel consumption is large
- Campus natural gas to electrical
