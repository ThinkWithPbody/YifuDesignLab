Shannon studied Structural Engineering at Dalhousie University before spending ten years as a consultant at Blackwell Engineering. She then experienced engineering from a manufacturer's perspective at Cast Connex, working with cast steel connections, before starting her own consulting engineering firm, fætlab, which specializes in feature elements and component design.

Shannon has worked on many exciting projects, such as York University Lassonde Engineering Building, Canadian Peace Bridge Plaza, University of Toronto Varsity Centre for High Performance Sports and the 30 College NCFS Longhouse. The common theme across all projects is the opportunity to interact with a selection of Canada’s best architects, fabricators, and general contractors.
