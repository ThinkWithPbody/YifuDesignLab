Hi there, thanks for stopping by (人´∀\`)

My name is Yifu, and this is a small part of my digital lab where I organize, retain, and share knowledge.


**I am a creative offering:**

Architecture & Design Services 
[Peer 3D Printing Service](/docs/Projects/2024/Yifu%20Design%20Lab/index.md) 
[Blender Files & Scripts](https://30salt.gumroad.com/) 


**Or... you might be looking for:**

My [Rhino](/docs/Wiki/Rhino.md) custom settings and scripts 
My [Resonant Orbit Calculator](/docs/assets/img/Resonant%20Orbit%20Calculator.py) for KSP 
A guide on using [SPT](/docs/Projects/2024/Escape%20From%20Tarkov/index.md) 
Or some Obsidian related Guides 


**What have I been up to?**

Moving this site from Quartz back to MkDocs...
Drooling over [ROG Flow Z13](https://rog.asus.com/ca-en/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/)
Admiring this DeltaV [Map](https://deltavmap.github.io/?system=Solar) and [Calculator](https://deltavmap.github.io/calculators.html?system=earth)
~~Closely stalking [TURD](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/174188-112x-textures-unlimited-recolour-depot/) updates... still... so I can blow Jeb up with style~~ Chugging along with my first RP-1 play through, which magically took care of TURD installation! 
Thinking about not being an INTJ-A...
