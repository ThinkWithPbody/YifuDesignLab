### File Preparation

> [!todo]- Step 1: Scale
> 
> Scale the model to printed size
> - Double check document tolerances before scaling to avoid inaccuracies.

> [!todo]- Step 2: Orientate
> Choose printing **orientation** for maximum smoothness. 
> - Printing a thin, organic piece vertically provides smoother detail and needs less support than laying it flat on the bed.

> [!todo]- Step 3: Divide
> Divide large models exceeding the **build volume** with a **planar** cutter to provide **flat surfaces** that will adhere to the print bed nicely.
> - Each model need to be a closed solid with no non-manifold geometry. They should be **watertight**.
> - For pieces that are thin and tall, width-height ratio is recommended to not exceed 1:8.
> - Keep in mind that any **overhang** exceeding 25 degrees will need substantial support structure which could be reduced or eliminated if they were divided and orientated differently.
> - `WireCut` is a great command for dividing your model. If `WireCut` didn't work on your model, chances are it isn't watertight and it won't print properly either.

> [!todo]- Step 4: Export
> Export files as **STL** in **millimetres**.
> - Rhino files or incorrectly scaled STL will not be accepted.
> - **Each separated body should be one .stl file** to maximize nesting potential.
> 	- When relative positioning is important but adding a base plate is too costly, add a small flat connecting bridge with a height of 1 to 2 `LayerHeight` directly on the print bed and `BooleanUnion` all connected bodies.
> - To export objects, use `RunPythonScript` with the [[![[../../../assets/img/BatchExportSTLByObj.py|BatchExportSTLByObj]]]] to export all selected files at once.
> - Deliver more than one .stl files as a **ZIP**.

### FAQ

###### Why is there a setup fee

Our machine time and filament pricing reflects the bare minimum machine and material cost. This setup fee compensates me for my continued presence and allows me to take more care optimizing your print file. Print file optimizations can massively reduce your print time and filament use, lowering total cost, but each job is different and it takes time. I try my best to provide affordable and environmentally responsible printing service, which is why I offer my time and expertise at a modest fee. You'll always have the option to slice it by yourself and I am pleased to waive the setup fee for such cases, but current success rate for this option is only 0%.
