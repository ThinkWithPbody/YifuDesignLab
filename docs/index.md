	One bright day in the middle of the night
	Two dead boys got up to a fight
	Back to back they faced each other
	Drew their swords and shot each other

Hi there, thanks for stopping by (人´∀\`)

My name is Yifu, and this is a small part of my digital lab where I organize, retain, and share knowledge.

**I am a creative offering:**

A guide on using [[./Projects/2024/Escape From Tarkov/index|SPT]]
Or some Obsidian related [[./Guides/index|Guides]]

**What have I been up to?**

Moving this site from Quartz back to MkDocs...
Drooling over [ROG Flow Z13](https://rog.asus.com/ca-en/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/)
Admiring this DeltaV [Map](https://deltavmap.github.io/?system=Solar) and [Calculator](https://deltavmap.github.io/calculators.html?system=earth)
~~Closely stalking [TURD](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/174188-112x-textures-unlimited-recolour-depot/) updates... still... so I can blow Jeb up with style~~ Chugging along with my first RP-1 play through, which magically took care of TURD installation!
Thinking about not being an INTJ-A...
