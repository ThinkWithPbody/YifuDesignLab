Hi there, thanks for stopping by (人´∀\`)

My name is Yifu, and this is a small part of my digital lab where I organize, retain, and share knowledge.


**I am a creative offering:**

Architecture & Design Services 
[[undefinedhidden/Yifu Design Lab|Peer 3D Printing Service]] 
[Blender Files & Scripts](https://30salt.gumroad.com/) 


**Or... you might be looking for:**

My [[undefinedhidden/Rhino|Rhino]] custom settings and scripts 
My [[undefined_assets/img/Resonant Orbit Calculator.py|Resonant Orbit Calculator]] for KSP 
A guide on using [[undefinedhidden/Escape From Tarkov|SPT]] 
Or some Obsidian related [[Guides|Guides]] 


**What have I been up to?**

Moving this site from Quartz back to MkDocs... why did I put myself through this lol
Drooling over [ROG Flow Z13](https://rog.asus.com/ca-en/laptops/rog-flow/rog-flow-z13-2025/)
Admiring the DeltaV [Map](https://deltavmap.github.io/?system=Solar) and [Calculator](https://deltavmap.github.io/calculators.html?system=earth)
Closely stalking [TURD](https://forum.kerbalspaceprogram.com/topic/174188-112x-textures-unlimited-recolour-depot/) updates... still... so I can blow Jeb up with style
