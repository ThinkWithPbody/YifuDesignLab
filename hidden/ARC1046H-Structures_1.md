- No organic materials
- Excavations cleaned by hand (if you have to pick it up by hand, it goes)

Bearing Capacity must be greater than Bearing Pressure (Bf)
Br > Bf
Bf = Pf "Factored Loads" / A (m^2) "Area of Bearing"

| Type and Condition of Soil or Rock | Maximum Allowable Bearing Pressure (kPa (kN / m^2)) |
| ---- | ---- |

Structural engineering considers [[ARC1046H-Structures_1#Strength|Strength]], [[ARC1046H-Structures_1#Structure|Structure]], [[ARC1046H-Structures_1#Stiffness|Stiffness]], [[ARC1046H-Structures_1#Stability|Stability]].

#### Structure
#### Strength
The amount of load a structure can sustain prior to failure.

Load on the system has to be less than the load capacity of the system that sustains load. 
##### Load factor

**Factor of safety** of 2: the system can sustain twice the load expected.

Pf: factor of load
Vf: factor of shear
Mf: factor of moment
Tf: 

##### Capacity reduced

Pr: resistance of load
Vr: resistance of shear
Mr: resistance of moment

##### Types of forces
###### Compression
Always a secondary factor resulting tension failure.
###### Tension
###### Shear
V.F *kN*
On concrete, it’s a tension failure on the diagonal.
*Concrete Punching Shear*
###### Bending
Compression and Tension acting on either sides, a tension failure on the tension side.
Steel beam fails by yielding both in compression and tension.
###### Torsion
Shear around the perimeter. 
###### Moment
M.F *kNm*
Distance moved * force = 1 kNm = 1,000,000 Nmm
###### Connection Failures
- Screws shearing, bending.
- Plate in tension.
- Anchor pullout

#### Stiffness
The amount of force required to make a structure deflect by some fixed increment. 
Represented by symbol **K**.
Flexibility is the amount that a structure will deflect or rotate under a fixed amount of load.

**Guidelines**
- Comfort
- Preservation of Finishes
- Stability
- Drainage
- Interface with Building Elements

**Serviceability Limit**
[SERVICEABILITY LIMITS.pdf](file:///D:%5COneDrive%20-%20University%20of%20Toronto%5C_twp%5CDocument%5CScholar%5CUTOR%5C2024-01%5CARC1046H%5CFiles%5CReadings%5CSERVICEABILITY%20LIMITS.pdf)

**Vertical**
- Live: L/360
- Total: L/240

**Horizontal**
- H/500

**Rotational**

**Soil**
Differential settlement

**Vibration**
Continuous vibrations
- 2.5 Hz

Transient vibrations
- Heel drop
- Load is damped by mass of building and 
- Limit the acceleration to 1% of gravity

Amplified vibrations (resonance)


#### Stability
The state of being stable, or the opposite of in-stable. Instability can be elastic, ponding, tipping, or sliding. 

**Sliding**
- Resistance by friction

**Tipping**

**Elastic**
- Stable
	- Columns converge on a limit visually straight
- Unstable
	- Not stiff enough causing more and more elastic instability

**Ponding**
- Stable
- Unstable
	- More sagging allows accumulation of more water causing more sagging

**No load path**

**Buckling**
- **Overall**
- **Lateral torsional**
- **Local**
	- Instability resulting from a compressive load

### Module 2

![[undefined_assets/img/Assignment 02-6.jpg|Assignment 02-6]]

Structural drawing
one should be able to build the entire structure from structural drawings
- Grid identification
- Grid dimensions
- Labels
- Sizing
- Framing
- Gravity system
- Lateral Load resisting system (LLRS)
- Cantilevers 


- Steel
	- Single line on plans
- Wood
	- Wavy line hatch in plan
	- Cross in section
- Open web steel joist (generic truss, not typically what we refer to when we say truss)

Steel and concrete building: 
- Foundation and basement plan
	- Plans are drawn:
		- mostly cut above and look down
			- More standard practice
			- Doesn’t necessarily make sense because it’s more useful to see the beams supporting floors than this floor 
		- Cut below and look up
		- Like a reflected ceiling plan (used to be the standard practice in 70s, now replaced by more rigorous standards)
	- Note elevations on drawing
		- Elevations of slabs typically noted
		- Depths (pits) are referenced locally, relative to the drawing
	- Cardinal vs Ordinal
		- Cardinal
			- North South West East
		- Ordinal
			- Contextual
			- Right
			- Left
		- Geo datum as cardinal, others as ordinal
	- Put the grids in the most convenient place to offset from foundations
		- [x] ![[undefined_assets/img/ARC1046H Structures 1 2024-01-17.png|ARC1046H Structures 1 2024-01-17]]%%[[ARC1046H Structures 1 2024-01-17|🖋 Edit in Excalidraw]]%%  [completion:: 2024-04-10]
	- Only describe the extent when it’s not obvious
	- Describe top of steel / beam everywhere (sometimes indicated on schedule)
		- sometimes, indicate under side of deck, and top of steel is at underside of deck unless noted
	- Don’t detail the connections unless it’s special
	- Horizontal or vertical text for horizontal or vertical elements
		- 45 degrees for elements going in and out of the page
	- Show the information in the first and most useful place to show for the contractor
		- show information on footing and column schedule when there’s no space
	- Factor loads
	- Service level loads for foundations (to estimate settlement)
	- If it’s not in the price, it’s not in the contract; don’t bury scope,  are sure every piece is in the price making the project easier to build
		- Describe as much scope as you can in plan
		- Most things in sections
		- Half in details

Concrete buildings:
- Grids start from outer edge of slab, and interior columns are still centered on grids
- Working steel (load bearing) in one direction, nominal or non-working steel in the other for temperature changes
- Pour a diamond on slab on grade to prevent reentering corner (inverted, inside corner) from forming cracks in concrete where it connects

Tributary area: 
- Beams:
	- Purlin
	- Joist
	- Beam
	- Girder
- Tributary width typically equals span
- Tributary area = tributary width * length

- Roof system:
	- Support environmental loads (and possibly Occupant Loads
	- Slope to drains
	- Possibly integral to fire separation
	- Support the building envelope (insulation and roofing)
	- Diaphragm action (keep a building square in plan)
	- Transfer Loads to vertical supports (Walls, Columns)
- Floor system:
	- Support occupant loads 
	- Transfer Loads to vertical supports (Walls, Columns)
	- To provide the concrete wearing surface or the base for special finishes or coverings.

	- Possibly integral to fire separation
- Columns and walls
	- Reinforced Concrete Columns and Walls
	- Concrete Block, Brick or Stone Masonry
	- Structural Steel Columns

	- Light Gauge Steel Bearing Walls
	- Roles
		- Transfer the gravity loads (dead and live) from the floor or roof to the foundation. 
		- Cladding Support
		- Wind loads
- Compression elements roles burdens
	- Not to squash under load
	- Not to buckle under load
	- Not to deflect excessively
	- Possibly: not to bend under wind load
	- Possibly: be part of the LLRS
- Guidelines for designing the Supporting System
	- Regular layout
	- Make use of architectural elements
	- Load lateral load resisting elements
	- Repetition
	- Multiple storey column lifts (steel)
	- Minimize transfers
- Cold and hot rolled steel

	- Flange thickness and web thickness not necessarily same width, not working as hard as flange

Steel construction
- Always intumescent paint for exposed steel for fireproof
- Used for shorter buildings because building wood concrete form is expensive of not reused
- Used for very tall buildings because they are lighter
- Sizing guidelines
	- General
		- d = l / 20
		- w = h / 25
	- Corrugated metal deck
		- Standard depth: d = 38mm
		- d = l / 50
	- Concrete slab metal deck
		- d = 38 or 76mm + concrete
		- d = l / 20
	- Open web steel joist OWSJ
		- 50mm increments 
		- d = l / 16
	- Steel beams
		- Purlins d = l / 25
		- Beans d = l / 20
		- Girders d = l / 15
		- Beam width b = d / 2.5, 2-3 (very rough estimate)
	- Trusses
		- 50mm increments
		- d = l / 12
	- Columns
		- Standard sizes listed in CISC steel handbook
		- w = h / 20-40 (20 towards heavy loads, 40 towards slenderness)
	- Cantilever
		- Half of regular rule of thumb

Steel is deepest or longest because it’s strongest
Concrete is the shallowest system because it’s weak
The structural system with the least expensive deck is the least expensive system because there is more deck than anything else
Deeper is cheaper

HSS: hollow steel section

Transfer: load taken to the nearest possible columns

**Analogous Point Load Free Body Diagram (APL):** 
Representing distributed loads (UDL) as an equivalent point load can help simplify the diagram. It will have the same effect on the equilibrium of the Free Body Diagram (FBD) (so also the reactions). But not the TOTAL shear and bending moment diagram.
