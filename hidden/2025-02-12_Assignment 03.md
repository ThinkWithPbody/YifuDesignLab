![[Periodic Notes/Atomic/2025/2025-02-12_Assignment 03/2025-02-12_Assignment 03.png|Periodic Notes/Atomic/2025/2025-02-12_Assignment 03/2025-02-12_Assignment 03.png]]

Scored 22/24

**Question 1**
Solve the following:
![[undefined_assets/img/Pasted image 20250122151527.png|200]]
P = 95 kN  
w = 59 mm  
l = 59 mm  
σ = ? MPa
Write the answer in MPa to 1 decimal place (XX.X). Do not write the units.

$\sigma(N/mm^2|MPa)=\frac{P(N)}{A(mm^2)}$
$\sigma=95000/59^2=27.3$

---

**Question 2**
Solve the following
σ  = 38 MPa  
P = 264 kN  
A = ? mm2
Write the answer in mm2 to 0 decimal places. Do not write the units.

$A=\frac{P}{\sigma}=264000/38=6947$

---

**Question 3**
You are designing a baseplate for a column that sits on a concrete foundation wall with f’c = 25 MPa. You know f’c is another term for maximum stress, and that your column in supporting 750 kN. The wall is 200mm wide, so you have to limit your baseplate to be 150 mm wide. How long does your baseplate need to be to support P but not over-stress the concrete?

0.20 mm
125 mm
✔️200 mm
4500 mm

$A=\frac{P}{\sigma}=750000/25=30000(m^2)$

After Covid vaccinations, Shannon and Dave are going to a very fancy banquet (he’s not allowed to wear his shorts), so they get all dressed up. Shannon is wearing a beautiful pair of stiletto heels and Dave is wearing his brand new men’s dress shoes. Each of the heels on Shannon’s shoes has an area of 20mm x 20mm and Dave’s are 70mm x 70mm. It’s summer, so Dave weights 190lbs, and Shannon has started working out and weights 130lbs.   
Walking to the banquet, they come to a muddy area. Their brother-in-law is a geological engineer, and they remember him telling them that this particular type of mud has a bearing stress of 0.5 MPa

Answer the next four questions:
Tip: There would be a time when only 1 heel would be in contact with the ground.

**Question 4**
Can Dave walk across the muddy ground?

No
✔️Yes

$1 lbs=0.4535924 kg$
$Gravity=9.80665 m/s^2$
$190 lbs=845.1622 N$
$\sigma_\text{Dave}(N/mm^2|MPa)=\frac{P(N)}{A(mm^2)}=\frac{845.1622}{4900}=0.1725 MPa < 0.5 MPa$

---

**Question 5**
Can Shannon walk across the muddy ground?

✔️No
Yes

$\sigma_\text{Shannon}=1.4457 MPa$

---

**Question 6**
Can Dave carry Shannon across the muddy ground?

No
✔️Yes

$\sigma_\text{D+S}=0.2905MPa$

---

**Question 7**
Solve the following:  
ΔL = 50 mm  
Lo = 10 m  
ε  = ?

✔️0.005 mm/mm
0.2 mm/mm
5 mm/mm
200 mm/mm

$\varepsilon (mm/mm|Unitless)=\frac{\Delta L(mm)}{L(mm)}$
$\varepsilon=50/10000=0.005$

---

**Question 8**
Solve the following  
ε  = 0.0015 mm/mm  
ΔL = 5 mm  
Lo = ?
Write the answer in **mm** to 0 decimal places (XXXX). Do not write the units.

$L_o=5/0.0015=3333$

---

**Question 9**
There is a new building material on the market! The pamphlet in the design library at your office says it can have a stress of up to 50MPa. You are designing a bar that has an area of 50mm x 50mm. What force can the member take?
Write your answer in **kN** to zero decimal places (XXX)

$50*50*50/1000=125$

---

**Question 10**
You’ve noticed the bar of new material in the previous question was originally 2.5m long and is now 2.505m long.
What is the strain? 
Write your answer in mm/mm (unitless) to 3 decimal places (X.XXX)

$\varepsilon=0.005/2.5=0.002$

---

**Question 11**
Thinking of the previous question, what would the strain value be if you used the final length of the bar (2.505 m) instead of the original length in the strain equation? The change in length remains the same.
Write your answer in mm/mm (unitless) to 6 decimal places (X.XXXXXX)

$\varepsilon=0.005/2.505=0.001996$

---

**Question 12**
Comparing the strain values you calculated in the previous two questions (using L original vs L final) does it seem like a big difference? We are using this to discuss small deflections of large things (think buildings and their members). I touched on this in the lecture.

✔️No
Yes

---

**Question 13**
Dave’s shorts elastic is 32”. In the summer, when they fit perfectly, his waist is exactly 32”!
What is the strain on his elastic in the summer?

$0$

---

**Question 14**
Dave’s shorts elastic is 32”. In the fall though, his waist is 34”.
What is the strain on his elastic in the fall?
(Keep three significant figures)

$2/32=0.0625$

---

**Question 15**
Dave’s shorts elastic is 32”. By the holidays, his waist is 36”.  
What is the strain on his elastic after the holidays?
(Keep three significant figures)

$4/32=0.125$

---

**Question 16**
For the three previous questions, did it matter if we would in inches or millimetres?

✔️No
Yes

---

**Question 17**
Solve the following  
E = 27 MPa  
ε = 0.0010  
σ = ?
Write the answer in MPa to 3 decimal places (X.XXX). Do not write the units.

$E=\displaystyle \frac{\sigma}{\varepsilon}$
$\sigma=27*0.0010=0.027$

---

**Question 18**
Solve the following  
E = 200,000 MPa  
ε = 0.0010  
σ = ?
Write the answer in MPa to 0 decimal places (XXX). Do not write the units.

$\sigma=200000*0.0010=200$

---

**Question 19**
If a materiel has a stress of σ = 350 MPa and a strain of ε = 0.00175 mm/mm, what is the Modulus of Elasticity, E?
Write the answer in MPa to 0 decimal places. Do not write the units.

$E=350MPa/0.00175=200,000$

---

**Question 20**
You need to hang a sign that weights 207 kN on two rods that are 20 mm in diameter. They are made with steel that has a Modulus of Elasticity of 200,000 MPa. If the rods are originally two meters long, how much do they stretch?
Remember the load is shared between the rods. Write your answer in mm to two decimal places (X.XX). Do not write the units.

$\sigma=\frac{207000}{20^2*2}=258.75MPa$
$\varepsilon=\sigma/E=0.00129375$
$\Delta L=2m\times0.00129375\times1000mm/m=2.59mm$

---

For the next few questions, refer to the following Stress-Strain Curve

**Question 23**
What is the strain at rupture?

It does not rupture

This question is not marked. Feel free to recopy this and complete it in excel or on a piece of paper.

You’ve been in the lab testing dog-bone samples of that new material  from question 3 to help prove the Modulus of Elasticity we calculated in question 12. You know what the area of your sample is (10mm x 40mm) and you know how long it is (200mm). As you apply load, you measure how much the sample stretches. Calculate the stress and strain for each stage of the test, then plot the stress-strain curve for the data you have. What is the Modulus of Elasticity?
